I've seen the same pattern in many different fields: even though lots of people have worked hard in the field, only a small fraction of the space of possibilities has been explored, because they've all worked on similar things.

我在许多不同领域看到了相同的模式：尽管许多人在该领域努力工作，但仅探索了很小一部分的可能性空间，因为他们都在从事相似的工作。

Even the smartest, most imaginative people are surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who would never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems.
即使是最聪明，最有想象力的人，在决定要做什么时，也会出奇的保守。那些从未梦想过以其他任何方式成为时髦的人被卷入对时髦问题的研究中。

If you want to try working on unfashionable problems, one of the best places to look is in fields that people think have already been fully explored: essays, Lisp, venture funding — you may notice a pattern here. If you can find a new approach into a big but apparently played out field, the value of whatever you discover will be [multiplied](http://paulgraham.com/sun.html) by its enormous surface area.

如果你想尝试解决不时髦的问题，那么最好的去处之一就是人们认为已经充分探索的领域：文章，Lisp和风险投资—你可能会在这里注意到一种模式。如果你能找到一个新方法，进入一个广阔但显然已淘汰的领域，那么发现的任何东西的价值将[乘以](http://paulgraham.com/sun.html) 其巨大的表面积。

The best protection against getting drawn into working on the same things as everyone else may be to [genuinely love](http://paulgraham.com/genius.html) what you're doing. Then you'll continue to work on it even if you make the same mistake as other people and think that it's too marginal to matter.

避免陷入与其他人一样的事情上的最佳保护，是[真诚地热爱](http://paulgraham.com/genius.html)你所做的事情。然后，即使你犯了与其他人相同的错误，并认为这无关紧要，你仍将继续努力。
