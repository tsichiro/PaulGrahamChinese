# 成为菜鸟（[Being a Noob](http://paulgraham.com/noob.html)）

When I was young, I thought old people had everything figured out. Now that I'm old, I know this isn't true.

当我还年轻的时候，我以为老人们已经掌握了一切。现在我已经老了，我发现这是不对的。

I constantly feel like a noob. It seems like I'm always talking to some startup working in a new field I know nothing about, or reading a book about a topic I don't understand well enough, or visiting some new country where I don't know how things work.

我一直觉得自己像个菜鸟。似乎我一直在和一些在我所陌生的新领域工作的初创公司交谈，或者读一本我不太了解的主题的书，或者在一个我不知道事情如何运作的新国家旅行。

It's not pleasant to feel like a noob. And the word "noob" is certainly not a compliment. And yet today I realized something encouraging about being a noob: the more of a noob you are locally, the less of a noob you are globally.

像个菜鸟一样的感觉并不愉快。而且“菜鸟”这个词当然不是恭维。但是今天，我意识到成为菜鸟有一些令人鼓舞的地方：你在局部的越是个菜鸟，在全局就越不是个菜鸟。

For example, if you stay in your home country, you'll feel less of a noob than if you move to Farawavia, where everything works differently. And yet you'll know more if you move. So the feeling of being a noob is inversely correlated with actual ignorance.

例如，如果你留在自己的祖国，比你搬到法拉瓦维亚的菜鸟般的感觉要少，因为那里的一切运作方式都不一样。但是，如果你搬家，你会知道更多。因此，成为菜鸟的感觉与实际的无知成反比。

But if the feeling of being a noob is good for us, why do we dislike it? What evolutionary purpose could such an aversion serve?

但是，如果成为菜鸟的感觉对我们有好处，为什么我们不喜欢它呢？这种反向行为有什么进化目的？

I think the answer is that there are two sources of feeling like a noob: being stupid, and doing something novel. Our dislike of feeling like a noob is our brain telling us "Come on, come on, figure this out." Which was the right thing to be thinking for most of human history. The life of hunter-gatherers was complex, but it didn't change as much as life does now. They didn't suddenly have to figure out what to do about cryptocurrency. So it made sense to be biased toward competence at existing problems over the discovery of new ones. It made sense for humans to dislike the feeling of being a noob, just as, in a world where food was scarce, it made sense for them to dislike the feeling of being hungry.

我认为答案是，有两种感觉像菜鸟那样：愚蠢和做新奇的事情。我们不喜欢菜鸟般的感觉是我们的大脑告诉我们“来吧，来吧，解决这个问题”。对于大多数人类历史而言，这是正确的思考。狩猎采集者的生活很复杂，但是没有像现在变化这么大。他们不必突然知道如何处理加密货币。因此，偏向于现有问题的能力而非发现新问题是有道理的。对人类来说，不喜欢成为菜鸟的感觉是有道理的，就像在一个食物匮乏的世界中，对他们来说，和不喜欢饥饿的感觉一样。

Now that too much food is more of a problem than too little, our dislike of feeling hungry leads us astray. And I think our dislike of feeling like a noob does too.

现在问题变成食物过多而不再过少，我们对饥饿感的厌恶使我们误入歧途。而且我认为我们也讨厌像菜鸟那样的感觉。

Though it feels unpleasant, and people will sometimes ridicule you for it, the more you feel like a noob, the better.

尽管感觉不愉快，有时人们会为此而嘲笑你，但你越觉得自己像个菜鸟就会越好。
