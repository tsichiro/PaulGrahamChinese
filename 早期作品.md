# 早期作品（[Early Work](http://paulgraham.com/early.html)）

October 2020

2020年10月

One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an irrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on where they don't seem very impressive, even to their creators. You have to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies beyond. But many people don't. Most people don't even reach the stage of making something they're embarrassed by, let alone continue past it. They're too frightened even to start.

大家不去做出色的作品，一个最大的原因是担心做出差劲的东西。这种担心并非毫无道理。许多出色的项目在早期都经历了一个并不让人印象深刻的阶段，即使对它们的创作者而言也是如此。万事开头难，跨过这个阶段才能达到出色作品的彼岸。但是很多人没有。甚至，大多数人不会去做那些令其感到尴尬的事，更不用说坚持跨越那个阶段了。他们过于害怕而开始不了。

Imagine if we could turn off the fear of making something lame. Imagine how much more we'd do.

想象一下，如果我们能够消除对做出差劲作品的担心。去想象我们还能做多少。

Is there any hope of turning it off? I think so. I think the habits at work here are not very deeply rooted.

是否有希望将其消除？我觉得有。我认为这里的**工作习惯**并没有根深蒂固。

Making new things is itself a new thing for us as a species. It has always happened, but till the last few centuries it happened so slowly as to be invisible to individual humans. And since we didn't need customs for dealing with new ideas, we didn't develop any.

创造新事物本身是我们人类这个物种一个新的本领。它一直在发生，但是直到最近几个世纪，它的发生是如此缓慢，以至于每个人都看不见。而且由于我们不需要处理新想法的**习俗**，因此我们也没有进行开发。

We just don't have enough experience with early versions of ambitious projects to know how to respond to them. We judge them as we would judge more finished work, or less ambitious projects. We don't realize they're a special case.

我们只是对雄心勃勃的项目的早期版本没有足够的经验，无法知道如何应对它们。我们评判他们就像评判偏于完成的作品，或不那么雄心勃勃的项目一样。我们没有意识到它们是特例。

Or at least, most of us don't. One reason I'm confident we can do better is that it's already starting to happen. There are already a few places that are living in the future in this respect. Silicon Valley is one of them: an unknown person working on a strange-sounding idea won't automatically be dismissed the way they would back home. In Silicon Valley, people have learned how dangerous that is.

或者至少，我们大多数人没有。我相信我们可以做得更好，原因之一就是它已经开始发生。在这方面，有一些的地方已经活在未来。硅谷就是其中之一：一个陌生人正在研究一个听起来很奇怪的想法，不会在他们回家的路上自动被解雇。在硅谷，人们已经知道那是多么危险。

The right way to deal with new ideas is to treat them as a challenge to your imagination — not just to have lower standards, but to [switch polarity](http://paulgraham.com/altair.html) entirely, from listing the reasons an idea won't work to trying to think of ways it could. That's what I do when I meet people with new ideas. I've become quite good at it, but I've had a lot of practice. Being a partner at Y Combinator means being practically immersed in strange-sounding ideas proposed by unknown people. Every six months you get thousands of new ones thrown at you and have to sort through them, knowing that in a world with a power-law distribution of outcomes, it will be painfully obvious if you miss the needle in this haystack. Optimism becomes urgent.

处理新想法的正确方法是将它们视为对你想象力的挑战——不仅要降低标准，而且要完全[改变极性](http://paulgraham.com/altair.html)，从列出一个想法行不通的原因到尝试思考可行的方法。当我遇到有新想法的人时，我就是这样做的。我已经很擅长了，但是我已经做了很多练习。作为Y Combinator的合伙人，意味着几乎沉浸在陌生人提出的奇怪想法中。每六个月，就会有成千上万的新想法涌向你，你不得不对它们进行分类，知道在一个结果具有幂律分布的世界中，如果你错过了大海中的那根针，那将是非常痛苦的。**乐观主义变得迫在眉睫**。

But I'm hopeful that, with time, this kind of optimism can become widespread enough that it becomes a social custom, not just a trick used by a few specialists. It is after all an extremely lucrative trick, and those tend to spread quickly.

但是我希望，随着时间的流逝，这种乐观主义会变得普遍，普遍到成为一种社会习俗，而不仅仅属于少数专家所使用的窍门。毕竟，这是一个极其有利可图的窍门，而且这些**窍门**往往会迅速传播。

Of course, inexperience is not the only reason people are too harsh on early versions of ambitious projects. They also do it to seem clever. And in a field where the new ideas are risky, like startups, those who dismiss them are in fact more likely to be right. Just not when their predictions are [weighted by outcome](http://paulgraham.com/swan.html).

当然，人们对雄心勃勃的项目的早期版本过于苛刻，经验不足不是唯一原因。他们这样做还可以看起来很聪明。在像创业公司这样的新想法都很冒险的领域，那些驳斥它们的人实际上更可能是正确的。**当他们的预测[受到结果的影响](http://paulgraham.com/swan.html)时，情况并非如此**。

But there is another more sinister reason people dismiss new ideas. If you try something ambitious, many of those around you will hope, consciously or unconsciously, that you'll fail. They worry that if you try something ambitious and succeed, it will put you above them. In some countries this is not just an individual failing but part of the national culture.

但是，人们拒绝新想法还有另一个更加阴险的原因。如果你尝试雄心勃勃的事情，周围的许多人都将有意或无意地希望你会失败。他们担心，如果你尝试雄心勃勃的事情并取得成功，它将使你凌驾于他们之上。在某些国家，这不仅是个人的失败，而且是民族文化的一部分。

I wouldn't claim that people in Silicon Valley overcome these impulses because they're morally better. [^1] The reason many hope you'll succeed is that they hope to rise with you. With investors this incentive is particularly explicit. They want you to succeed because they hope you'll make them rich in the process. But many other people you meet can hope to benefit in some way from your success. At the very least they'll be able to say, when you're famous, that they've known you since way back.

我不会说硅谷的人们因为更道德而克服了这些冲动[^1]。许多人希望你会成功的原因是他们希望与你一起成长。对于投资者而言，这种激励机制尤其明显。他们希望你成功，因为他们希望你能在此过程中让他们致富。而你遇到的许多其他人可能希望从你的成功中以某种方式受益。至少，当你出名时，他们将能够说，他们老早就认识了你。

But even if Silicon Valley's encouraging attitude is rooted in self-interest, it has over time actually grown into a sort of benevolence. Encouraging startups has been practiced for so long that it has become a custom. Now it just seems that that's what one does with startups.

但是，即使硅谷的鼓励态度植根于个人利益，但随着时间的流逝，它实际上已经变成一种仁慈。鼓励创业公司已经实践了很长时间，以至已成为一种习惯。现在看来，这就是对待初创公司要做的事情。

Maybe Silicon Valley is too optimistic. Maybe it's too easily fooled by impostors. Many less optimistic journalists want to believe that. But the lists of impostors they cite are suspiciously short, and plagued with asterisks [^2]. If you use revenue as the test, Silicon Valley's optimism seems better tuned than the rest of the world's. And because it works, it will spread.

也许硅谷太乐观了。也许它很容易被骗子愚弄。许多不那么乐观的记者希望大家相信这一点。但是，他们列举的骗子名单可疑的短，而且充满星号[^2]。如果你以财政收入作为测试，那么硅谷的乐观情绪似乎比世界其他国家调整得更好。而且因为它行得通，所以会传得开。

There's a lot more to new ideas than new startup ideas, of course. The fear of making something lame holds people back in every field. But Silicon Valley shows how quickly customs can evolve to support new ideas. And that in turn proves that dismissing new ideas is not so deeply rooted in human nature that it can't be unlearnt.

当然，新想法比新的创业公司的想法要多得多。**对做出差劲作品的担心让各个领域的人们退缩**。但是，硅谷显示出习俗可以快速演进以支持新的想法。这反过来证明，驳斥新的想法并非深深植根于人性，它不是天生具备的。

___________

Unfortunately, if you want to do new things, you'll face a force more powerful than other people's skepticism: your own skepticism. You too will judge your early work too harshly. How do you avoid that?

不幸的是，如果你想做新的事情，你将面对比其他人的怀疑更强的阻力：你自己的怀疑。你也将过于苛刻地判断你的早期作品。你如何避免这种情况？

This is a difficult problem, because you don't want to completely eliminate your horror of making something lame. That's what steers you toward doing good work. You just want to turn it off temporarily, the way a painkiller temporarily turns off pain.

这是一个棘手的问题，因为你不想完全消除对做出差劲作品的担心。那是你做出出色作品的引导。你只想暂时将其屏蔽，就像止痛药暂时止疼的方式一样。

People have already discovered several techniques that work. Hardy mentions two in A *Mathematician's Apology*:
> Good work is not done by "humble" men. It is one of the first duties of a professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate a little both the importance of his subject and his importance in it.

If you overestimate the importance of what you're working on, that will compensate for your mistakenly harsh judgment of your initial results. If you look at something that's 20% of the way to a goal worth 100 and conclude that it's 10% of the way to a goal worth 200, your estimate of its expected value is correct even though both components are wrong.

人们已经发现了几种有效的技巧。Hardy在《数学家的致歉》中提到了两个：
> 出色的工作不是由“谦虚”的人完成的。例如，在任何学科中，教授的首要职责之一就是稍微夸大其学科以及他在其中的重要性。

如果你高估了你所从事工作的重要性，那将弥补你对最初结果的错误性的苛刻判断。如果你看某样东西，达到目标的方法的20％价值100，并且得出结论，那是达到目标的方法的10％价值200，那么即使两个要素均不正确，你对预期值的估计也是正确的。

It also helps, as Hardy suggests, to be slightly overconfident. I've noticed in many fields that the most successful people are slightly overconfident. On the face of it this seems implausible. Surely it would be optimal to have exactly the right estimate of one's abilities. How could it be an advantage to be mistaken? Because this error compensates for other sources of error in the opposite direction: being slightly overconfident armors you against both other people's skepticism and your own.

正如Hardy所建议的那样，这也有助于保持略微自负。我注意到在许多领域，最成功的人都有些略微自负。从表面上看，这似乎是不可信的。当然，最好是对自己的能力进行正确的估计。弄错怎么会有优势呢？因为此错误会补偿相反方向上的其他错误：略微自负会帮你抵御他人和你自己的怀疑。

Ignorance has a similar effect. It's safe to make the mistake of judging early work as finished work if you're a sufficiently lax judge of finished work. I doubt it's possible to cultivate this kind of ignorance, but empirically it's a real advantage, especially for the young.

无知有类似的效果。如果你是一个对完工作品足够宽松的评价者，那么像完工作品那样去评价早期工作的错误是无所谓的。我怀疑是否有可能培养这种无知，但从经验上讲，这是真正的优势，尤其是对于年轻人而言。

Another way to get through the lame phase of ambitious projects is to surround yourself with the right people — to create an eddy in the social headwind. But it's not enough to collect people who are always encouraging. You'd learn to discount that. You need colleagues who can actually tell an ugly duckling from a baby swan. The people best able to do this are those working on similar projects of their own, which is why university departments and research labs work so well. You don't need institutions to collect colleagues. They naturally coalesce, given the chance. But it's very much worth accelerating this process by seeking out other people trying to do new things.

穿越雄心勃勃的项目的差劲阶段的另一种方法是让自己与合适的人在一起——在社会的逆风中创造漩涡。但是汇集那些一直在鼓励的人
还不够。你得学会低估这些。你需要一些可以真正分辨出小天鹅和丑小鸭的同行。最有能力做到这一点的人就是那些自己从事类似项目的人，这就是为什么大学院系和研究实验室表现出色的原因。你不需要学院来汇集同行。如果有机会，他们自然会抱团。但是通过寻找其他尝试做新事物的人来加速这一过程非常值得。

Teachers are in effect a special case of colleagues. It's a teacher's job both to see the promise of early work and to encourage you to continue. But teachers who are good at this are unfortunately quite rare, so if you have the opportunity to learn from one, take it. [^3]

实际上，教师是同行的特例。看到早期工作的希望并鼓励你继续，即是老师的职责。但是不幸的是，擅长于此的老师很少见，因此，如果你有机会向其中一个学习，请抓住[^3]。

For some it might work to rely on sheer discipline: to tell yourself that you just have to press on through the intial crap phase and not get discouraged. But like a lot of "just tell yourself" advice, this is harder than it sounds. And it gets still harder as you get older, because your standards rise. The old do have one compensating advantage though: they've been through this before.

对于某些人来说，依靠纯粹的纪律可能会奏效：告诉自己，你只需要坚持最初的胡言乱语，并且不要灰心丧气。但是，就像许多“只告诉自己”的建议一样，这比听起来要难。随着年龄的增长，它还会变得越来越困难，因为你的标准不断提高。不过，年长的确实有一个补偿优势：他们以前曾经经历过。

It can help if you focus less on where you are and more on the rate of change. You won't worry so much about doing bad work if you can see it improving. Obviously the faster it improves, the easier this is. So when you start something new, it's good if you can spend a lot of time on it. That's another advantage of being young: you tend to have bigger blocks of time.

如果你较少关注自己在哪里而更多地关注变化率，则可以提供帮助。如果你发现作品有所改善，则不必过于担心做得不好。显然，改善得越快，这样就越简单。因此，当你开始做一些新的事情时，如果可以花很多时间在上面，那就太好了。那是年轻的另一个优点：你往往会有更大把的时间。

Another common trick is to start by considering new work to be of a different, less exacting type. To start a painting saying that it's just a sketch, or a new piece of software saying that it's just a quick hack. Then you judge your initial results by a lower standard. Once the project is rolling you can sneakily convert it to something more. [^4]

另一个常见的窍门是从考虑新作品是与众不同和不太严格的类型开始。要开始画一幅画，说它只是一个草图，或者一款新软件，说它只是一个快速破解。然后，你以较低的标准来判断你的初始结果。项目启动后，你可以轻松地将其转换为其他内容[^4]。

This will be easier if you use a medium that lets you work fast and doesn't require too much commitment up front. It's easier to convince yourself that something is just a sketch when you're drawing in a notebook than when you're carving stone. Plus you get initial results faster. [^5] [^6]

如果你使用一种可以让你快速工作并且不需要预先太多承诺的介质，这将变得更加容易。在笔记本中绘图比雕刻石头更容易说服自己这只是一个草图。另外，你可以更快地获得初始结果[^5] [^6]。

It will be easier to try out a risky project if you think of it as a way to learn and not just as a way to make something. Then even if the project truly is a failure, you'll still have gained by it. If the problem is sharply enough defined, failure itself is knowledge: if the theorem you're trying to prove turns out to be false, or you use a structural member of a certain size and it fails under stress, you've learned something, even if it isn't what you wanted to learn. [^7]

如果你将冒险的项目视为学习而非做事的一种方式，则尝试会更容易。这样，即使该项目确实失败了，你仍然会从中受益。如果对问题的定义足够清晰，则失败本身就是知识：如果你要证明的定理被证明是错误的，或者你使用一定大小的结构性构件而在压力作用下失败，则你已经学到了一些东西，即使这不是你想要学习的[^7]。

One motivation that works particularly well for me is curiosity. I like to try new things just to see how they'll turn out. We started Y Combinator in this spirit, and it was one of main things that kept me going while I was working on [Bel](http://paulgraham.com/bel.html). Having worked for so long with various dialects of Lisp, I was very curious to see what its inherent shape was: what you'd end up with if you followed the axiomatic approach all the way.

对我特别有效的一种动机是好奇心。我喜欢尝试新事物，只是看看它们会如何发展。我们本着这种精神创立了Y Combinator，这是我从事[Bel](http://paulgraham.com/bel.html)创作时让我前进的主要因素之一 。在使用Lisp的各种方言工作了这么长时间之后，我很想知道它的内在模型是什么：**如果始终遵循公理化方法，最终会得到什么**。

But it's a bit strange that you have to play mind games with yourself to avoid being discouraged by lame-looking early efforts. The thing you're trying to trick yourself into believing is in fact the truth. A lame-looking early version of an ambitious project truly is more valuable than it seems. So the ultimate solution may be to teach yourself that.

但是，有点奇怪的是，你必须自己玩心理游戏，以免被看上去差劲的早期努力所挫败。你努力欺骗自己去相信的东西，实际上是事实。一个雄心勃勃的项目的看上去差劲的早期版本，确实比看起来更有价值。因此，最终的解决方案可能是教你自己。

One way to do it is to study the histories of people who've done great work. What were they thinking early on? What was the very first thing they did? It can sometimes be hard to get an accurate answer to this question, because people are often embarrassed by their earliest work and make little effort to publish it. (They too misjudge it.) But when you can get an accurate picture of the first steps someone made on the path to some great work, they're often pretty feeble. [^8]

一种方法是学习那些完成过出色作品的作者的历史。他们在早期思考什么？他们做的头一件事是什么？有时很难准确地回答这个问题，因为人们常常为最早的工作而感到尴尬，并且很少花精力去发表它。（他们也判断错了。）但是，当你准确地了解某人在迈向出色工作道路上迈出的第一步时，他们通常会显得无能为力[^8]。

Perhaps if you study enough such cases, you can teach yourself to be a better judge of early work. Then you'll be immune both to other people's skepticism and your own fear of making something lame. You'll see early work for what it is.

也许，如果你研究了足够多的此类案例，则可以教会自己成为早期工作的更好的判断者。这样一来，你既可以免疫于他人的怀疑和你自己对做出差劲作品的担心。你会发现早期工作的实质。

Curiously enough, the solution to the problem of judging early work too harshly is to realize that our attitudes toward it are themselves early work. Holding everything to the same standard is a crude version 1. We're already evolving better customs, and we can already see signs of how big the payoff will be.

奇怪的是，过分苛刻地判断早期工作的解决方案，是意识到我们对此的态度本身就是早期工作。对所有东西保持相同的标准是，粗糙的版本1。我们已经在发展更好的习俗，并且我们已经看到了收益将有多大的迹象。

注意事项

[^1] This assumption may be too conservative. There is some evidence that historically the Bay Area has attracted a different sort of person than, say, New York City.

[^1] 这个假设可能太保守了。有证据表明，从历史上看，湾区吸引的人不同于纽约市。

[^2] One of their great favorites is Theranos. But the most conspicuous feature of Theranos's cap table is the absence of Silicon Valley firms. Journalists were fooled by Theranos, but Silicon Valley investors weren't.

[^2] Theranos是他们的最爱之一。但是，Theranos上限表最明显的特征是缺少硅谷公司。记者被塞拉诺斯（Theranos）愚弄了，但硅谷的投资者却没有。

[^3] I made two mistakes about teachers when I was younger. I cared more about professors' research than their reputations as teachers, and I was also wrong about what it meant to be a good teacher. I thought it simply meant to be good at explaining things.


[ 3]我小时候对老师犯了两个错误。我更关心教授的研究，而不是他们作为老师的声誉，而且我对成为一名好老师的含义也是错误的。我认为这只是要善于解释事物。

[^4] Patrick Collison points out that you can go past treating something as a hack in the sense of a prototype and onward to the sense of the word that means something closer to a practical joke:
I think there may be something related to being a hack that can be powerful — the idea of making the tenuousness and implausibility a feature. "Yes, it's a bit ridiculous, right? I'm just trying to see how far such a naive approach can get." YC seemed to me to have this characteristic.
[^5] Much of the advantage of switching from physical to digital media is not the software per se but that it lets you start something new with little upfront commitment.

[^4]帕特里克·科里森（Patrick Collison）指出，从原型的意义上讲，你可以超越某些东西，而从词的意义上讲，这更像是一个恶作剧：
我认为可能存在一些与强大的骇客有关的事情-使脆弱性和不可信性 成为一个特征。“是的，这有点荒谬，对吗？我只是想看看这种天真的方法能走多远。” 在我看来，YC具有这种特征。
[^5]从物理媒体切换到数字媒体的许多优势并不是软件本身，而是它使你无需承担任何先期投入即可开始新的工作。

[^6] John Carmack adds:
The value of a medium without a vast gulf between the early work and the final work is exemplified in game mods. The original Quake game was a golden age for mods, because everything was very flexible, but so crude due to technical limitations, that quick hacks to try out a gameplay idea weren't all that far from the official game. Many careers were born from that, but as the commercial game quality improved over the years, it became almost a full time job to make a successful mod that would be appreciated by the community. This was dramatically reversed with Minecraft and later Roblox, where the entire esthetic of the experience was so explicitly crude that innovative gameplay concepts became the overriding value. These "crude" game mods by single authors are now often bigger deals than massive professional teams' work.

[^6] John Carmack添加：
游戏mod中举例说明了在早期工作和最终工作之间没有巨大鸿沟的媒介的价值。原来雷神之锤游戏是一个黄金时代MODS的，因为一切是非常灵活的，但这么原油由于技术的限制，即快速黑客尝试一个游戏的想法并不都是那远离官方游戏。许多职业都是从此诞生的，但是随着这些年来商业游戏质量的提高，制作成功的mod几乎成为了全职工作，受到了社区的赞赏。这在Minecraft和后来的Roblox中得到了极大的扭转，在这里，整个体验的美感是如此的粗糙，以至于创新的游戏概念成为了最重要的价值。现在，单身作者的这些“粗俗”游戏模式通常比大规模专业团队的工作更重要。

[^7] Lisa Randall suggests that we
treat new things as experiments. That way there's no such thing as failing, since you learn something no matter what. You treat it like an experiment in the sense that if it really rules something out, you give up and move on, but if there's some way to vary it to make it work better, go ahead and do that


[^7]丽莎·兰德尔（Lisa Randall）建议我们
将新事物视为实验。这样就不会有失败的事情，因为无论如何你都会学到一些东西。从某种意义上说，你将其视为实验，如果它确实排除了某些东西，则你会放弃并继续前进，但是如果有某种方法可以对其进行改进以使其更好地工作，请继续进行下去

[^8] Michael Nielsen points out that the internet has made this easier, because you can see programmers' first commits, musicians' first videos, and so on.




[^8] Michael Nielsen指出，互联网使这一过程变得更加容易，因为你可以看到程序员的首次提交，音乐家的第一次录像等等。
