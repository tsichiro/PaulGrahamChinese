What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.

一篇文章应该是什么样的？很多人会回答有说服力。那就是我们很多人被教导的文章应该有的样子。但是我认为我们可以力争更具野心：文章应该是实用的。

To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough merely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on.

首先，这意味着它应该是正确的。但是，仅仅正确是不够的。通过使陈述含糊不清，很容易使其正确。例如，这是学术写作中的常见缺陷。如果你对某个问题一无所知，则可以通过说该问题是一个复杂的问题，要考虑的因素很多，过于简单地看待它是一个错误，这样就不会出错，等等。

Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing. Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.

尽管毫无疑问是正确的，但这种说法相当于什么都没有告诉读者。实用写作在不出错的前提下尽可能地作出强的主张。

For example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the middle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because it's a bit east of the middle.

例如，说派克峰（Pike's Peak）在科罗拉多州的中部比在科罗拉多州的某个地方更实用。但是，如果我说它位于科罗拉多州的正中央，那么我过头了，因为它位于中间偏东。

Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues. Useful writing is bold, but true.

精确性和正确性就像相反的力量。如果忽略另一个，很容易满足一个。狂热的学术著作的反面是煽动者的大胆但虚假的言论。实用写作是大胆的，但是真实的。

It's also two other things: it tells people something important, and that at least some of them didn't already know.

这也是另外两件事：它告诉人们一些重要的事情，并且至少其中一些人还不知道。

Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean surprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more fundamental.

告诉别人他们不知道的事情并不总是意味着让他们感到惊讶。有时，这意味着告诉他们一些他们不自觉地知道但从未付诸于文字。实际上，这些可能是更有价值的见解，因为它们往往更基础。

Let's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.

让我们把它们放在一起。实用写作告诉人们他们还不知道的真实和重要的事情，并尽可能明确地告诉他们。

Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can't expect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's 7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers.

注意这些都是一个程度问题。例如，你不能指望一个创意对每个人都是新颖的。世界上70亿人口中的至少一个可能已经拥有你的任何见解。但是，如果一个想法对许多读者来说都是新颖的就足够了。

Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but nonetheless true.

同上，以确保正确性，重要性和强度。实际上，这四个部分就像数字，你可以将它们相乘以得到实用性得分。我意识到这简直是拙劣的简化，但仍然是对的。

How can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and important? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. I learned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying anything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure it's worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him, but when you do, they're usually right.

你如何确保所讲内容真实，新颖且重要？信不信由你，有一个诀窍。我是从我的朋友罗伯特·莫里斯（Robert Morris）那里学到的，他害怕说任何愚蠢的事情。他的诀窍是什么也不要说，除非它确定值得一听。这使得很难从他那里得到意见，但是当你这样做时，它们通常是正确的。

Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write a bad sentence, you don't publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.

转换到文章写作，这意味着如果你写了一个不好的句子，就不会发表。你将其删除，然后重试。通常，你会放弃四到五个段落的整个分支。有时是整篇文章。

You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can ensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the ones that aren't.

你不能确保你拥有的每个主意都是好的，但是你可以通过简单地不发布那些不好的主意来确保你发布的每个主意都是好的。

In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results, you're supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay writing, publication bias is the way to go.

在科学界，这被称为出版偏见，被认为是不好的。当你正在探索的某些假设得出不确定的结果时，你也应该告诉人们。但是，随着文章写作的发展，出版偏见是必经之路。

My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an essay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting it very carefully.

我的策略是先宽后严。我快速写了文章的初稿，尝试了各种想法。然后，我花几天的时间非常仔细地重写它。

I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but I'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing them. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or so I'm saying "Ugh, that part" each time I hit it. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won't publish an essay till they're all gone — till I can read through the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.

我从来没有尝试过统计我对文章的校对次数，但是我敢肯定有些句子在发表之前已经阅读了100次。当我对文章进行校对时，通常会有一些烦人的段落，有时是因为它们写得很笨拙，有时是因为我不确定它们是否正确。烦恼开始时是无意识的，但是在读完大约10遍后，每次我敲击它时，我都会说“额，那部分”。他们变得像野蔷薇一样，在你走过时抓住你的袖子。通常，直到它们全部消失后，我才发表文章-直到我能通读整个内容而不会感到任何困扰。

I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't think of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through one that doesn't seem correct. You never have to. If a sentence doesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and you've usually got the replacement right there in your head.

如果我想不出一种重新表达它的方法，有时我会说一个看起来很笨拙的句子，但我永远不会故意让看起来不正确的句子通过。你永远不必。如果一个句子看起来不正确，你所要做的就是问为什么不正确，而且通常你的脑海中就出现了替换词。

This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You don't have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as you need to get it right. You don't have to publish the essay at all, if you can't get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the face of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that's what it feels like. What's really going on is that you have different expectations for yourself. You're like a parent saying to a child "we can sit here all night till you eat your vegetables." Except you're the child too.

这是文章作者比新闻工作者更具优势的地方。你没有截止日期。你可以根据需要将文章写得很长。如果你做得不好，则根本不必发表文章。面对资源无限的敌人，错误似乎失去了勇气。或者就是这种感觉。真正发生的是你对自己有不同的期望。你就像父母对孩子说：“我们可以整夜坐在这里，直到你吃完蔬菜。” 除非你也是孩子。

I'm not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition (c) in "[A Way to Detect Bias](http://paulgraham.com/bias.html)" after readers pointed out that I'd omitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.

我并不是说没有遗漏错误。例如，在读者指出我将其省略之后，我在“[A Way to Detect Bias](http://paulgraham.com/bias.html)”中添加了条件（c）。但实际上，你几乎可以抓住所有这些错误。

There's a trick for getting importance too. It's like the trick I suggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something you yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader. The reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about topics that seem important to you, they'll probably seem important to a significant number of readers as well.

也有增加重要性的技巧。这就像我向年轻的创始人建议的窍门，让他们获得创业思路：做出自己想要的东西。你可以将自己作为读者的代理。读者并不完全不同于你，因此，如果你撰写对你来说很重要的主题，那么对于许多读者来说，它们可能也很重要。

Importance has two factors. It's the number of people something matters to, times how much it matters to them. Which means of course that it's not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemann sum.

重要性有两个因素。一是与此有关的人数，再乘以对他们有多重要。这当然意味着它不是矩形，而是一种参差不齐的梳型，就像黎曼和。

The way to get novelty is to write about topics you've thought about a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers. And here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you will. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't publish it.

获得新颖性的方法是写一些你已经深思熟虑过的主题。然后，你也可以将自己当作该部分读者的代理。如果你已经深思熟虑过某个主题，发现让你感到惊讶的东西，那么也可能让很多读者感到惊讶。在这里，与正确性和重要性一样，你可以使用Morris技术来确保自己会做到。如果你从撰写文章中学不到任何东西，请不要发表。

You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the novelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of it. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in this case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble. If you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit when you learn something you didn't know, because you can be confident that most other people wouldn't know it either.

你需要谦虚地衡量新颖性，因为承认一个想法的新颖性意味着要承认你以前对它的无知。自信和谦卑常常被看作是相反的，但是在这种情况下，就像在许多其他情况下一样，自信可以帮助你变得谦虚。如果你知道自己是某个主题的专家，则可以在学习不了解的知识时自由地承认，因为你可以确信大多数其他人也不知道。

The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two things: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. These two counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch in a car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expression of an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something you're sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all, as I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that seem dubious have to be held at arm's length with perhapses.

实用写作的第四要素，强度，来自于两件事：善于思考和熟练运用限定条件。两者相互抵消，就像手动变速箱汽车中的加速器和离合器一样。当你尝试完善想法的表达时，你会相应地调整限定条件。你确定的事情是，你可以毫无限定条件地直接陈述，就像我做了实用写作的四个部分一样。然而一些似乎可疑的观点必须辅之以不确定性。

As you refine an idea, you're pushing in the direction of less qualification. But you can rarely get it down to zero. Sometimes you don't even want to, if it's a side point and a fully refined version would be too long.

当你提炼一个想法时，你正在朝着更少限定条件的方向努力。但是你很少可以将其降低到零。有时，你甚至根本不想这样做，因为对于不重要的点而完全精制的版本可能太长了。

Some say that qualifications weaken writing. For example, that you should never begin a sentence in an essay with "I think," because if you're saying it, then of course you think it. And it's true that "I think x" is a weaker statement than simply "x." Which is exactly why you need "I think." You need it to express your degree of certainty.

有人说限定条件弱化了写作。例如，永远不要在文章中以“我认为”开始句子，因为如果你要说的话，那么你当然会认为。的确，“我认为x”比“ x”更弱。这就是为什么你需要“我认为”。你需要它来表达你的确定性程度。

But qualifications are not scalars. They're not just experimental error. There must be 50 things they can express: how broadly something applies, how you know it, how happy you are it's so, even how it could be falsified. I'm not going to try to explore the structure of qualification here. It's probably more complex than the whole topic of writing usefully. Instead I'll just give you a practical tip: Don't underestimate qualification. It's an important skill in its own right, not just a sort of tax you have to pay in order to avoid saying things that are false. So learn and use its full range. It may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it's part of having them.

但是限定条件不是标量。它们不只是实验错误。必然有50种事物他们可以表达：某种事物的适用范围，你如何知道的，如此你有多么快乐，甚至如何被伪造。我不会在这里尝试探索限定条件的结构。它可能比实用写作的整个主题要复杂得多。相反，我只是给你一个实用的提示：不要低估限定条件。这本身就是一项重要的技能，而不仅仅是为了避免说错话而必须支付的一种税。因此，请学习和使用其全部内容。拥有好主意可能并不完全是一半，但是拥有好主意是其中的一部分。

There's one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don't think this is a component of usefulness. It's more a matter of consideration for the reader. And it's a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I'll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader's sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that's too long.

我在文章中还追求另一种特质：说的尽可能简单。但是我不认为这是实用性的组成部分。对于读者来说，这更是一个为读者而考虑的问题。这是做对事情的实用助手。用简单的语言表达时，错误更加明显。但是我会承认，我写得简单的主要原因不是出于读者的缘故，也不是因为它有助于使事情变得正确，而是因为它困扰我去使用比我需要的单词更多或更奇特的单词。看起来不雅，就像程序太长一样。

I realize florid writing works for some people. But unless you're sure you're one of them, the best advice is to write as simply as you can.

我意识到有些人会写些华丽的作品。但是除非你确定自己是其中之一，否则最好的建议是尽可能简单地写作。

I believe the formula I've given you, importance + novelty + correctness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay. But I should warn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad.

我相信我给你的公式，重要性+新颖性+正确性+强度，是写一篇好文章的秘诀。但我应该警告你，这也是使人们疯狂的良方。

The root of the problem is novelty. When you tell people something they didn't know, they don't always thank you for it. Sometimes the reason people don't know something is because they don't want to know it. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief. And indeed, if you're looking for novel ideas, popular but mistaken beliefs are a good place to find them. Every popular mistaken belief creates a dead zone of ideas around it that are relatively unexplored because they contradict it.

问题的根源是新颖性。当你告诉别人他们不知道的事情时，他们并不总是为此感谢你。有时候，人们不知道某事的原因是因为他们不想知道某事。通常是因为它与某些珍视的信念相矛盾。确实，如果你正在寻找新颖的想法，那么流行但错误的信念就是找到它们的好地方。每个流行的错误信念都会在其周围产生一个死角的想法区，因为它们与之相矛盾，所以相对未发掘。

The strength component just makes things worse. If there's anything that annoys people more than having their cherished assumptions contradicted, it's having them flatly contradicted.

强度的部分只会使情况变得更糟。如果有比珍视的假设被反驳更让人抓狂的东西，那就是断然被反驳。

Plus if you've used the Morris technique, your writing will seem quite confident. Perhaps offensively confident, to people who disagree with you. The reason you'll seem confident is that you are confident: you've cheated, by only publishing the things you're sure of. It will seem to people who try to disagree with you that you never admit you're wrong. In fact you constantly admit you're wrong. You just do it before publishing instead of after.

另外，如果你使用过莫里斯技术，你的写作似乎会很有信心。对于不同意你的人，可能会过于自信。你看上去有信心的原因是你有信心：你作弊了，因为你仅发布你确定的内容。这看上去就是那些试图不同意你的人永远不会承认你错了。实际上，你一直在承认自己错了。你只是在发布之前承认而不是在之后。

And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things worse. Brevity is the diction of command. If you watch someone delivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, you'll notice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow. Whereas to be short with someone is more or less to be rude to them.

而且，如果你的写作尽可能的简单，那只会使事情变得更糟。简洁是命令式的措辞。如果你关注某人从卑微的立场发出不受欢迎的新闻，你会发现他们倾向于使用大量的词语来缓和语气。而某人或多或少对他们无礼时，则言语不多。

It can sometimes work to deliberately phrase statements more weakly than you mean. To put "perhaps" in front of something you're actually quite sure of. But you'll notice that when writers do this, they usually do it with a wink.

有时可以故意使表述比你的真实想法更弱。在你实际很确定的某些事情前面加上“可能”。但是你会注意到，当作家这样做时，他们通常会闪烁其词。

I don't like to do this too much. It's cheesy to adopt an ironic tone for a whole essay. I think we just have to face the fact that elegance and curtness are two names for the same thing.

我不太喜欢这样做。在整篇文章中采用具有讽刺意味的语气是很俗气的。我认为我们只需要面对这样的事实，优雅和简洁是同一件事的两个名字。

You might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure that an essay is correct, it will be invulnerable to attack. That's sort of true. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. But in practice that's little consolation.

你可能会认为，如果你努力工作以确保一篇文章是正确的，那么它将是无懈可击的。没错。对于有根据的攻击是无懈可击的。但是实际操作上，这并没有什么可慰藉的。

In fact, the strength component of useful writing will make you particularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. If you've stated an idea as strongly as you could without making it false, all anyone has to do is to exaggerate slightly what you said, and now it is false.

实际上，实用写作的强度成分将使你特别容易出现虚假陈述。如果你尽可能强地提出了一个命题而不出错，任何人所要做的就是稍微夸大你说的内容，然后就不再正确。

Much of the time they're not even doing it deliberately. One of the most surprising things you'll discover, if you start writing essays, is that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what you've actually written. Instead they make up something you said and disagree with that.

很多时候，他们甚至没有故意这样做。如果你开始撰写文章，你会发现的最令人惊讶的事情之一就是，与你意见不同的人很少会不同意你的实际所写的。相反，他们编造你所说的话，并对此表示反对。

For what it's worth, the countermove is to ask someone who does this to quote a specific sentence or passage you wrote that they believe is false, and explain why. I say "for what it's worth" because they never do. So although it might seem that this could get a broken discussion back on track, the truth is that it was never on track in the first place.

无论如何，对策就是要求这样做的人引用你写的特定句子或段落，即那些他们认为是错误的，并解释原因。我之所以说“无论如何”，是因为他们从不这样做。因此，尽管似乎这可能使破裂的讨论重新回到正轨，但事实是，它从一开始就不在正轨上。

Should you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations? Yes, if they're misinterpretations a reasonably smart and well-intentioned person might make. In fact it's sometimes better to say something slightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get an idea right in one shot. That can be more efficient, and can also model the way such an idea would be discovered.

你是否应该明确阻止可能的误解？是的，如果存在一个相当聪明且善意的人可能会造成的误解。实际上，有时候说些稍微误导人的话然后再加上更正的内容比尝试一次正确地提出想法要好。这样可以更有效，也可以为发现这种想法的方式建模。

But I don't think you should explicitly forestall intentional misinterpretations in the body of an essay. An essay is a place to meet honest readers. You don't want to spoil your house by putting bars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones. The place to protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes. But don't think you can predict them all. People are as ingenious at misrepresenting you when you say something they don't want to hear as they are at coming up with rationalizations for things they want to do but know they shouldn't. I suspect it's the same skill.

但是我认为你不应该在文章正文中明确阻止有意的误解。文章是结识诚实读者的地方。你不想通过在窗户上放栏以防止不诚实的行为，但却毁坏了房屋。在尾注中提供了防止有意误解的地方。但不要认为你可以预测所有。当你说出他们不想听的话时，人们总是像在为他们想做的但不该做的事情提出合理化建议那样，相当巧妙地歪曲你。我怀疑这是同样的技能。

As with most other things, the way to get better at writing essays is to practice. But how do you start? Now that we've examined the structure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question more precisely. Which constraint do you relax initially? The answer is, the first component of importance: the number of people who care about what you write.

与大多数其他事情一样，提高文章写作水平的方法是练习。但是你如何开始呢？现在，我们已经研究了实用写作的结构，我们可以更精确地重新表述该问题。你最初放宽哪些约束？答案是第一部分，重要性，即关注你所写内容的人数。

If you narrow the topic sufficiently, you can probably find something you're an expert on. Write about that to start with. If you only have ten readers who care, that's fine. You're helping them, and you're writing. Later you can expand the breadth of topics you write about.

如果你缩小主题范围，你可能会找到自己擅长的领域。从这个开始写。如果你只有十个关注的读者，那很好。你正在帮助他们，并且你正在写作。稍后，你可以扩展所写主题的广度。

The other constraint you can relax is a little surprising: publication. Writing essays doesn't have to mean publishing them. That may seem strange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but it worked for me. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks for about 15 years. I never published any of them and never expected to. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. But when the web came along I'd had a lot of practice.

你可以放宽的其他限制有点令人惊讶：发布。撰写文章并不一定意味着发表文章。这似乎很奇怪，既然趋势是发布所有随机的想法，但是它对我实用。我在笔记本上写了差不多15年的文章。我从未发表过任何文章，也从未期望过。我写它们是为了弄清楚事情。但是当网络出现时，我已经做了很多练习。

Incidentally, Steve Wozniak did the same thing. In high school he designed computers on paper for fun. He couldn't build them because he couldn't afford the components. But when Intel launched 4K DRAMs in 1975, he was ready.

顺便说一句，史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克（ Steve Wozniak）也做了同样的事情。在高中时，他在纸上设计电脑来娱乐。他无法建造它们，因为他负担不起这些组件。但是当英特尔于1975年推出4K DRAM时，他已经做好了准备。

How many essays are there left to write though? The answer to that question is probably the most exciting thing I've learned about essay writing. Nearly all of them are left to write.

剩下多少篇文章可以写？这个问题的答案可能是我从文章写作中学到的最激动人心的东西。几乎所有这些东西都可以写。

Although the essay is an old form, it hasn't been assiduously cultivated. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there wasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many. You could publish essays if you were already well known for writing something else, like novels. Or you could write book reviews that you took over to express your own ideas. But there was not really a direct path to becoming an essayist. Which meant few essays got written, and those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects.

尽管文章是一种古老的形式，但它并没有得到刻苦的培养。在印刷时代，出版是昂贵的，需求不足以出版那么多文章。如果你以写小说等其他东西而闻名，则可以发表文章。或者，你可以为接收到书籍撰写书评，以表达自己的想法。但是，真正没有成为文章家的直接途径。这就意味着很少写文章，而且倾向于只涉及很小范围的主题。

Now, thanks to the internet, there's a path. Anyone can publish essays online. You start in obscurity, perhaps, but at least you can start. You don't need anyone's permission.

现在，借助互联网，有了一条路。任何人都可以在线发表文章。也许你一开始默默无闻，但至少可以开始。你不需要任何人的许可。

It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly for years, till some change makes it explode. Cryptography did this to number theory. The internet is doing it to the essay.

有时，一个知识领域静坐了好几年，直到发生一些变化使其爆炸。就如密码学对于数论所做的，互联网对于文章正在做的。

The exciting thing is not that there's a lot left to write, but that there's a lot left to discover. There's a certain kind of idea that's best discovered by writing essays. If most essays are still unwritten, most such ideas are still undiscovered.

令人兴奋的事情不是有很多可以写的东西，而是有很多可以发现的东西。有一写想法最好通过写文章来发现。如果大多数文章仍未撰写，则大多数此类想法仍未被发现。
